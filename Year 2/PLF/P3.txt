% Predicate to generate all subsets of a list
subsets(List, Subsets) :-
    subsets(List, [], Subsets).

% Base case: an empty list has one subset, which is the empty list itself
subsets([], Acc, [Acc]).

% Recursive case:
% For each element H in the original list, generate subsets both with and without H
subsets([H|T], Acc, Subsets) :-
    % Generate subsets with H
    subsets(T, [H|Acc], SubsetsWithoutH),
    % Generate subsets without H
    subsets(T, Acc, SubsetsWithH),
    % Combine the subsets with and without H
    append(SubsetsWithH, SubsetsWithoutH, Subsets).
